# BharatLens

AI-powered brand comparison tool to discover Indian and global brands.

## Platform Design

BharatLens is designed to empower conscious consumers by bridging the gap between global brands and quality Indian alternatives. The platform addresses a key challenge: discovering local brands that match or exceed the quality of international products.

The concept centers around informed decision-making. When users search for any commodity, they receive comprehensive comparisons that highlight both established global brands and emerging Indian alternatives, complete with pros, cons, and direct links to official websites.

## Approach

The platform leverages a two-stage AI pipeline:

1. **Real-time Discovery**: Exa AI performs intelligent web searches to gather current market data about brands in the specified category, ensuring up-to-date information.

2. **AI Analysis**: Gemini AI processes the search results to generate structured comparisons, analyzing brand strengths, weaknesses, and positioning to provide actionable insights.

This approach combines the freshness of real-time web data with the analytical power of large language models, delivering relevant and accurate brand comparisons without maintaining a static database.
